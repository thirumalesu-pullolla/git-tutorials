🧠 Why does a text editor open after git pull?
Because Git is trying to:

✍️ Let you edit the default merge commit message (e.g., "Merge branch 'main' of https://...")

✅ How to Handle It (Step by Step)
When you're in the text editor (usually vim, nano, etc.), do the following depending on the editor:

🖊️ 1. If it's vim (most common):
You'll see a screen like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/your-repo

# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
👉 Steps to exit and save:
Press i to enter insert mode (you can now edit the text if needed).

Press Esc to exit insert mode.

Type :wq and press Enter to write and quit.

✅ That completes the merge!

🖊️ 2. If it's nano (less common):
You’ll see the merge message with some instructions at the bottom like ^O WriteOut and ^X Exit.

👉 Steps:
Press Ctrl + O to write (save) the commit message.

Press Enter to confirm.

Press Ctrl + X to exit the editor.

💡 Pro Tip: Avoid Editor Popups (Auto-Merge)
You can auto-merge without opening an editor by using:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull --no-edit
This keeps the default merge message and avoids opening the editor.
