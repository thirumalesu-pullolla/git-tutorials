Purpose:
.gitignore is a file within a Git repository that specifies files and directories Git should ignore.

This prevents unnecessary files (like temporary files, configuration files, or build artifacts) from being tracked and committed.

Listing Ignored Items:
You must explicitly list the files and/or directories you want Git to ignore within the .gitignore file.

Examples of Syntax:
test.txt: Ignores a specific file named "test.txt".
config.js: Ignores a specific file named "config.js"
*.txt: Ignores all files with the ".txt" extension.
!test.txt: Negates the previous rule, meaning "test.txt" will not be ignored, even if a broader pattern would have excluded it.
folder_name/: Ignores a directory named "folder_name" and all its contents, including nested subdirectories.
/folder_name: Ignores a directory named "folder_name" only if it's located in the root directory of the repository.

Key points:
The order of the rules in the .gitignore file can be important, especially when using negation.
It is good practice to create a .gitignore file at the start of a project, and to add to it as needed.
