git clone <https repository link available under code section>
 
Git clone is used to get remote repositories into our local systems

We should have either access tokens or via collaborators option only we can able to push the changes made in the local to the remote repository

after adding someone as collaborator for our repository they have to accept our invitation before they are proceeding to made changes and try to push.

git clone https://thirumalesu-pullolla@github.com/thirumalesu-pullolla/git-tutorials.git (we should add username@github.com ) for access token type push.
