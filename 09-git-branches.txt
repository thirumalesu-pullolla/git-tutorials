Git branches :

Every git repository includes a default branch known as master/main

Branches allow developers to work on different features , bug fixes or experiments simultaneously without disturbing the main code

git branch		List all branches

git branch <name>	Create a new branch
git checkout <name>	Switch to a branch
git switch <name>	Alternate way to switch
git checkout -b <name>	Create and switch to new branch
git merge <name>	Merge a branch into current
git branch -d <name>	Delete a branch (if already merged)
git branch -D <name>	Force delete a branch (even if not merged)

After intiatalizing a folder as git repository we cannot see git branches 
We can see git branches only after some commits.

after doing the changes in the branches we have to switch to the branch (mostly master) in which we have to merge changes.

Then use (git merge <working branch name>) to update this changes to master branch.
